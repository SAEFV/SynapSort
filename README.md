# SynapSort - My Journey in Building an AI-Powered Thought Organizer

## Introduction
SynapSort is a personal project where I explore ways to manage cognitive overload using AI. My goal is to create a system that organizes my thoughts, tracks my projects, and helps me prioritize tasks by integrating local AI models, Firefox history, and project directories.

This is not necessarily a project meant to be cloned but rather a documentation of my process, challenges, and learnings along the way.

## What I Plan to Do
- **Build a local AI-powered assistant** to help sort and summarize thoughts
- **Integrate Firefox history** to extract useful insights from my browsing activity
- **Track my project directories** to keep priorities in check
- **Develop a simple note system** to store AI-processed thoughts
- **Create a minimal web interface** for easy interaction

## Technologies & Tools I’m Exploring
- **Local AI Models**: llama.cpp, GPT4All, or similar
- **Database**: SQLite for storing history and notes
- **Backend**: Python with Flask or FastAPI
- **Frontend**: A basic dashboard for interaction

## Progress & Challenges
I’ll be documenting my progress, discoveries, and obstacles as I go. This includes:
- Milestones I achieve
- Issues I run into
- Interesting findings while working on AI-powered organization

## Future Considerations
While I’m focusing on my personal needs, if this system turns out to be useful, I may explore:
- Expanding integrations (Joplin, Obsidian, Nextcloud, etc.)
- Enhancing AI capabilities for better prioritization
- Making the setup more modular for others to use

## Why I’m Doing This
Managing thoughts and priorities can be overwhelming, especially as someone who is autistic (and possibly ADHD). This project is a way to create a tool that aligns with how my brain works, helping me stay productive and organized.

## Follow My Journey
I'll be updating this repository as I make progress, so feel free to follow along if you're interested in AI-assisted personal organization!

This document will evolve as I work on SynapSort, and I’ll adjust my approach based on what I learn along the way.
